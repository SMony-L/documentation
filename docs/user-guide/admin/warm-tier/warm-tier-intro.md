Logz.io provides flexible options for storing and accessing data with Hot, Warm, and Cold tiers, each tailored to different access needs.

The Warm tier is designed to handle logs that don’t require frequent access but still need to be readily available for analysis and troubleshooting. By enabling Warm tier data, you can access historical data when necessary, making it a practical choice for mid-term storage.

## Warm tier use cases

The Warm Tier is ideal for scenarios where data is needed periodically but doesn’t demand the immediate speed of the Hot Tier. Key use cases include:

* **Historical Analysis**: Access past logs to gain insights, perform trend analysis, or examine event data weeks or months after ingestion.

* **Root Cause Analysis**: When troubleshooting, recent historical data often provides critical context. With the Warm Tier, logs can be accessed directly through Explore, allowing for in-depth investigations.

* **Compliance**: Many compliance regulations require data retention for a specified period. The Warm Tier facilitates compliance by keeping data accessible without incurring the costs of real-time storage.

Warm tier balances long-term retention and moderate performance for data storage needs. 

Logs automatically shift from the Hot to Warm tier after a set period, extending retention and enabling easy access to historical data for analysis, compliance, and reporting. Though slightly slower than the Hot tier, the Warm tier offers reliable search and query functionality suited for semi-active data.

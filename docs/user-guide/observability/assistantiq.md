Observability IQ Assistant is an AI-powered, chat-based interface that lets you engage in a dynamic conversation with your data. Use it to move beyond passive data viewing and get real-time insights about your metrics, anomalies, trends, and the overall health of your environment.

Observability IQ Assistant is available in your [Explore dashboard](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/explore), and as part of [Kubernetes 360](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/observability/k8s360), and [App 360](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/spm/service-overview).

The assistant suggests a few queries you can run on your data to help you start the analysis and deep-dive, or you can type your own questions.

The answers are based on the data currently shown on your dashboard. Once you change the query, apply filters, or change the time period, any new answer from the IQ Assistant will be based on the newly generated data. 

You can now leverage the insights from your dialog and enhance data analysis to make informed decisions.

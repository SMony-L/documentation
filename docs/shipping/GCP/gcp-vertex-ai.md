Google Vertex AI is a unified MLOps platform to help data scientists/ML engineers increase experimentation, deploy faster, and manage models with confidence. 

{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/gcp-logs.md}

For this integration, the telemetry list needs to include `visionai`, `aiplatform`.

### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).

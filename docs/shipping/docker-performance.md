Docker is a set of platform as a service products that deliver software in containers. This integration allows you to ship performance logs of your Docker containers to your Logz.io account.

docker pull logzio/logzio-perfagent
```

##### Run the Docker image

For a complete list of options, see the parameters below the code block.ðŸ‘‡

```shell
docker run -d \
  --net="host" \
  -e LOGZ_TOKEN="<<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>" \
  -e LISTENER="<<LISTENER-HOST>>:5000" \
  -e USER_TAG="workers" \

|---|---|---|
| LOGZ_TOKEN  | Your Logz.io account token. {@include: ../_include/log-shipping/log-shipping-token.html} | Required |
| LISTENER | Your account's listener host and port. {@include: ../_include/log-shipping/listener-var.html} | `listener.logz.io:5000` |

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd).

If you still don't see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).

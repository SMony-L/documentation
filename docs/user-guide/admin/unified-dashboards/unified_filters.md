title: Getting started with Unified filters


---

**Unified Filters** are part of the Logz.io [Unified Dashboard](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/unified_dashboards.html) feature, letting you narrow down logs, metrics, and traces data across your Metrics dashboards by creating a functional overview of your data. 

Each user can create their own list of filters, which apply to all Metrics dashboards.


#### Create a Unified filter


##### Open your Metrics account

Navigate to **[Metrics](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics)** > **Filters** > **Add a filter**.



##### Select the Unified variable

Filters use [Unified Variables](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/unified_variables.html), and the drop-down list includes all of the existing variables in your account, showing the number of fields included in each one. 

Once you select a Unified Variable, you'll be able to view which fields it contains.

##### Choose condition

Logz.io offers some conditions you can apply to your filters. Choose the one that matches your needs, and **Save**. The filter is automatically applied across your Metrics dashboards.

#### Remove/toggle filters

You can **remove** filters by clicking the X located next to them. To disable all active filters, use the toggle in the upper right.

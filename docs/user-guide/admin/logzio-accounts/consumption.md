Logz.io's consumption-based model allows you to tailor your budget to cover all your data monitoring needs, including logs, metrics, traces, and SIEM. This approach lets you view and analyze various data types within your account, with charges applied based on the volume of GB and Unique Metrics ingested.

Prices per GB and Unique Metrics vary according to your overall budget. You can review the different offerings on [Logz.ioâ€™s Pricing page](https://logz.io).

As part of the new model, you can configure the maximum amount of data you want ingested per data type. This can help prevent unexpected data spikes and enable you to prioritize the most relevant data.

If you reach your preconfigured ingestion cap, the system will halt further data intake. However, account admins can modify these limits as needed through the Manage Accounts page.

Once you reach your allocated budget, data ingestion will continue, and additional charges will be calculated using On-Demand rates. 

You can contact your Logz.io account manager or [Logz.io's support team](mailto:help@logz.io) to adjust your budget accordingly.

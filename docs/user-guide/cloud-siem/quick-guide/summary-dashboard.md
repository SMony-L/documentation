The **Summary** dashboard is the default screen you can see when accessing your Cloud SIEM account.

The default view shows a summary of events that occurred in the past 24 hours. You can change the default time frame by clicking on the calendar icon at the top right corner of the screen to choose a custom timeline.

You can inspect each tile by clicking on the three dots > inspect. This will open a side menu with additional info to help you understand what's happening in your SIEM environment.

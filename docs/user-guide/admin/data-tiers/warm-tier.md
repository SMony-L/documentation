Warm tier is a storage option designed for data that is not frequently accessed but still needs to be readily available for analysis and troubleshooting. It provides a practical solution for mid-term storage ensuring you can retrieve historical data when required.

:::info note
Warm tier configuration can be set up by contacting the [Sales team](mailto:sales@logz.io).

## Setting Up the Warm Tier

Once Warm Tier has been enabled on your Logz.io account, you can assign it to one or more of your sub-accounts. To do so, navigate to [Manage Accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts), select the sub account you want to configure, choose the desired Warm Tier retention period, and click **Apply** to save your changes.

## Accessing Warm Tier Data

After activation, all users can access Warm Tier data through [Explore](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/explore).

Open the time picker, where indicators show the availability of Warm or Hot data. Hover over specific dates to view a tooltip specifying the type of data available.

When selecting a date with Warm Data, a notification will inform you that retrieval may take several minutes. To proceed, manually apply the query by clicking **Apply Query** in the top-right corner. This step ensures intentional data retrieval, as Warm Data may take longer to load and incur additional costs.

While waiting for results, you can navigate away from Explore. Youâ€™ll receive an in-app notification once the data is ready.

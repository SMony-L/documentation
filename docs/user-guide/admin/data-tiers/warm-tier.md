## Accessing Warm Tier

Once Warm data has been activated on your account, all users can access it through from [Explore](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/explore).

You can identify available Warm Data by opening the time picker, where an indication appears at the bottom. As you hover over different dates, a tooltip will display whether each date contains Warm or Hot data.

When selecting a date that includes Warm Data, you’ll receive a notification indicating that retrieval may take longer, potentially several minutes. To proceed with the query, you'll need to click the **Apply Query** button at the top right to initiate the search. 

Results may take additional time to load. You can navigate away from Explore, and once the data is ready, you’ll be notified inside Logz.io's app.

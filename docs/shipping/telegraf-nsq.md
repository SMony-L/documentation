overview: This integration creates a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that links to your Amazon S3 metrics stream and then sends the metrics to your Logz.io account. It also creates a Lambda function that adds AWS namespaces to the metric stream, and a Lambda function that collects and ships the resources' tags.

## Overview

NSQ is a realtime distributed messaging platform designed to operate at scale, handling billions of messages per day. Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To read metrics from an NSQ topic, you need to add the **inputs.nsq** and **outputs.http** plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

#### Configuring Telegraf to send your metrics data to Logz.io

 

##### Set up Telegraf v1.17 or higher

{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-setup.md}
 
##### Add the inputs.nsq plug-in

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the NSQ data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:


``` ini
[[inputs.nsq]]
  ## An array of NSQD HTTP API endpoints
  endpoints  = ["http://localhost:4151"]

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false
```


:::note
The database name is only required for instantiating a connection with the server and does not restrict the databases that we collect metrics from. The full list of data scraping and configuring options can be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.18/plugins/inputs/nsq/README.md).
:::
 

##### Add the outputs.http plug-in

{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-outputs.md}
{@include: ../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders-prometheus.html}

##### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).

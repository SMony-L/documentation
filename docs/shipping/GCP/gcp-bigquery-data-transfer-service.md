The BigQuery Data Transfer Service automates data movement into BigQuery on a scheduled, managed basis. 


{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/gcp-metrics.md}  

For this integration, the telemetry list needs to include `bigquery_dts_config`.

### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).

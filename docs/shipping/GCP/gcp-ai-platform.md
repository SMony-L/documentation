Google AI Platform is a suite of services on Google Cloud specifically targeted at building, deploying, and managing machine learning models in the cloud.

{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/gcp-metrics.md}  

For this integration, the telemetry list needs to include `aiplatform`.


### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).

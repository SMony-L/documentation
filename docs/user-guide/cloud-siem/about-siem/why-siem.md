Logz.io [Cloud SIEM](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/security/summary) (_Security Information and Event Management_) aggregates security logs and alerts across distributed environments to allow your team to investigate security incidents from a single observability platform.

Cloud SIEM comes fully configured to save your team the effort of configuring hundreds of alerts and dashboards. Each integration includes a set of pre-configured security rules and dashboards that can form the basis of your security operations. You can further edit and expand on any existing rules, dashboards, and reports as you see fit.

Logz.io Cloud SIEM integrates with dozens of security services, including firewalls, end point security, network security, identity management security, and even container security.

As soon as you start using Cloud SIEM, your logs will be cross referenced against multiple Threat Intelligence feeds to flag malicious IPs, DNSs, and URLs and identify the method of attack. Cloud SIEM can help your team drastically reduce threat detection time and oversee the security of even the largest environments at scale, regardless of whether they are on-prem, cloud, or hybrid environments.

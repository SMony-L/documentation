* An active account with OneLogin
* An actie account with Logz.io

 

##### Login to your OneLogin account

Log in to your OneLogin account as admin.

Navigate to **Developers > Webhooks > New broadcaster**.

##### Fill out the **New broadcaster** dialog

* In the **Title** field, enter **logzio**.

* In the **Listener URL** field, enter `https://<<LISTENER-HOST>>:8071/?token=<<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>&type=onelogin`. {@include: ../_include/log-shipping/listener-var.html} {@include: ../_include/log-shipping/log-shipping-token.md}

When everything is filled out, click **Save**.


##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd). You can search for `type:onelogin` to filter for your OneLogin logs.
  
If you still donâ€™t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).

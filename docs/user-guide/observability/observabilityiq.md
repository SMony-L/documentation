Observability IQ is an AI-powered, chat-based interface that lets you engage in a dynamic conversation with your data.

Use Observability IQ to move beyond passive data viewing and get real-time insights about your metrics, anomalies, trends, and the overall health of your environment.

<h2 id="start"> Getting Started </h2>

Observability IQ is currently available inside your Services dashboard. To view it, navigate to [Services](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/spm/services/table) and choose one of your services.

Click the Observability IQ button at the top to open the interface. You'll get 4 pre-configured questions to help you start the analysis and deep-dive into the data, or you can type your own questions.

The answers are based on the graphs and data you see in real time. Once you change the time period or apply filters, new answers will focus on the newly generated data.

Observability IQ can help analyze trends in latency, throughput, error rate, and HTTP status codes over time to identify patterns or anomalies that may require attention. Additionally, it can compare the performance metrics of different operations to see if any significant differences need to be addressed.

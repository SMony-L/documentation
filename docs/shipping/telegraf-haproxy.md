## Overview

HAProxy is a free and open source software that provides a high availability load balancer and proxy server for TCP and HTTP-based applications that spreads requests across multiple servers. Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To send your Prometheus-format HAProxy metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the **inputs.haproxy** and **outputs.http** plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

#### Configuring Telegraf to send your metrics data to Logz.io

 

##### Set up Telegraf v1.17 or higher

{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-setup.md}
 
##### Add the inputs.haproxy plug-in

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the HAProxy data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:


``` ini
[[inputs.haproxy]]
  ## An array of address to gather stats about. Specify an ip on hostname
  ## with optional port. ie localhost, 10.10.3.33:1936, etc.
  ## Make sure you specify the complete path to the stats endpoint
  ## including the protocol, ie http://10.10.3.33:1936/haproxy?stats

  ## Credentials for basic HTTP authentication
  # username = "admin"
  # password = "admin"

  ## If no servers are specified, then default to 127.0.0.1:1936/haproxy?stats
  servers = ["http://myhaproxy.com:1936/haproxy?stats"]

  ## You can also use local socket with standard wildcard globbing.
  ## Server address not starting with 'http' will be treated as a possible
  ## socket, so both examples below are valid.
  # servers = ["socket:/run/haproxy/admin.sock", "/run/haproxy/*.sock"]

  ## By default, some of the fields are renamed from what haproxy calls them.
  ## Setting this option to true results in the plugin keeping the original
  ## field names.
  # keep_field_names = false

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false
```

:::note
The database name is only required for instantiating a connection with the server and does not restrict the databases that we collect metrics from. The full list of data scraping and configuring options can be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.18/plugins/inputs/haproxy/README.md).
:::
 

##### Add the outputs.http plug-in

{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-outputs.md}
{@include: ../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders-prometheus.html}

##### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).

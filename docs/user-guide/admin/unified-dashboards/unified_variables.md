title: Getting started with Unified Variables

---

**Unified Variables** represent a collection of fields from within your code. It lets you normalize data type names from multiple data sources by combining them into a single parameter.

These variables are the engine behind [Unified Filters](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/unified_filters.html), an additional feature that provides a comprehensive overview of your systems and applications.

<p class="info-box note">Only account admins can create, edit, and toggle Unified Variables. Account users can view the variables and their fields.</p>

#### Configure a Unified Variable

<div class="tasklist">

##### Name the variable

Navigate to **[Metrics](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics)** > **[Unified variables](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/global-variables)** > **[New variable](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/global-variables/new)**, or click the **+** sign next to Unified Variables in the vertical navigation. Give your Unified Variable a useful name to understand the fields it represents.

##### Add fields

Fields represent existing variables in your code and systems. Choose the field you'd like to include in the unified variable, and the data sources account in which it appears.

Navigate to the main Unified Variables screen to view all existing variables.

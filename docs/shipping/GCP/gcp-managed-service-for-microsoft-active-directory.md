Google Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory is a fully managed, real-time log management with storage, search, analysis and alerting at exabyte scale. 


{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/gcp-logs.md}  

For this integration, the telemetry list needs to include `microsoft_ad_domain`.

### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
